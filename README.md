# Machine-learning

# Key Terms
# Features
A set of quantities or properties describing an observation. They can be binary like "day" and "night"; categorical like "morning", "afternoon", and "evening"; continuous like 3.141; or ordinal like "threatened", "endangered", "extinct", where the categories can be ordered.

# Labels
Usually paired with a set of features for use in supervised learning. Can be discrete or continuous.

# Examples
Pairs of features and labels.

# Dimensions
Here, the number of features associated with a particular example.

# Vector
Here, a feature vector, which is a list of features representing a particular example.

# Matrix
An array of values, usually consisting of multiple rows and columns.

# Matrix Transpose
An operator that flips a matrix over its diagonal.

# Polynomial
A function with more than one variable/coefficient pair.

# Derivative
Indicates how much the output of a function will change with respect to a change in its input.

# Probability
How likely something is to occur. This can be independent, such as the roll of the dice, or conditional, such as drawing two cards subsequently out of a deck without replacement.

# Probability Distribution
A function that takes in an outcome and outputs the probability of that particular outcome occurring.

# Gaussian Distribution
A very common type of probability distribution which fits many real world observations; also called a normal distribution.

# Uniform Distribution
A probability distribution in which each outcome is equally likely; for example, rolling a normal six-sided die.
