Key Terms
Model
An approximation of a relationship between an input and an output.

Heuristic
An approach to finding a solution which is typically faster but less accurate than some optimal solution.

Bernoulli Distribution
A distribution which evaluates a particular outcome as binary. In the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier case, a word was either in a message or not in a message, which is binary representation.

Prior
Indicates the probability of a particular class regardless of the features of some example.

Likelihood
The probability of some features given a particular class.

Evidence
The denominator of the Naive Bayes classifier.
The probability of a class given some features.
The list of words that the Naive Bayes classifier recognizes.

Laplace Smoothing
A type of additive smoothing which mitigates the chance of encountering zero probabilities within the Naive Bayes classifier.

Tokenization
The splitting of some raw textual input into individual words or elements.

Featurization
The process of transforming raw inputs into something a model can perform training and predictions on.

Vectorizer
Used in a step of featurizing. It transforms some input into something else. One example is a binary vectorizer which transforms tokenized messages into a binary vector indicating which items in the vocabulary appear in the message.

Stop Word
A word, typically discarded, which doesn't add much predictive value.

Stemming
Removing the ending modifiers of words, leaving the stem of the word.

Lemmatization
A more calculated form of stemming which ensures the proper lemma results from removing the word modifiers.
